## Garage Demo

These recordings were done over two sessions form 2008 to 2009 in the Smith's garage up in New Hampshire.  They are all live takes from the Garage and feature the original lineup of Zack Smith, Nat MacDonald, and Matt Madison.  I recorded the sessions with different equipment so the quality may vary at times.
