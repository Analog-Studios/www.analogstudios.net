## Spiritual Warfare

After years of dabbling in producing Ryan Miller of Metal Wings&nbsp;finally committed to making a solo album when he&nbsp;decided to make &quot;Spiritual Warfare&quot;. &nbsp; The&nbsp;idea was to make a Hip Hop album based on the Bhagavad Gita that he had been working on and then&nbsp;one week in August, free time found Ryan Miller and he&nbsp;spent that time&nbsp;entirely making beats and writing verses. &nbsp;It was produced and mixed down at Analog Studios and released on iTunes in 2014.
