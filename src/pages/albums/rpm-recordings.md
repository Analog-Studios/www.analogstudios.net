## RPM Recordings

This recording was done in my apartment up in New Hampshire over a two day period. Rory and I intended this for the 2009 RPM Challenge but in the end is just became a cool, live, impromptu reocrding of Rory at his creative and spontaneous self. I apologize for the lack of title, for the next one I&#39;ll make sure Rory titles his songs, heh. Anyway, we recorded all these songs live, maybe with a couple of takes, and cut the results. Hope you enjoy them.
