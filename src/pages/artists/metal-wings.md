Metal Wings is Ryan Mialler,&nbsp;a Hip Hop producer,&nbsp;MC,&nbsp;and Yoga teacher. &nbsp;He&nbsp;wrote &quot;Another Fall Harvest&quot;&nbsp;in a single week in August 2012. After years of dabbling in producing he&nbsp;finally committed to making a solo album when I decided to make &quot;Spiritual Warfare&quot;&nbsp;and had&nbsp;it produced down at Analog Studios.&nbsp; Ryan is one of our good friends so please check out all his work on iTunes.
