## Laurent Bonetto

While pursuing a scientific career, Laurent has always kept playing the piano as one of the main occupations of his life; a passion he has had since the age of 5. Since the age of 15, he has practiced with concert pianist Nathalie Bera-Tagrine, with whom he studies when he returns to France. Laurent has taken numerous masters classes in Europe and the US, participated in many concerts, and competitions, and has recorded two piano CDs.
