A hard rock band from Conway, NH, Electro Calrissian knows how to crank out the tunes. Once a solid three piece, these days the lineup features songwriter Zack Smith on guitars, bass, and vocals and Nat MacDonald also playing guitar, bass, and singing.  Aside from their usual gigs, Zack can often be found playing down at Open Mic on Mondays at the Red Parka Pub or Matty Bs Pizza. Check out their MySpace page for more up to date info, music, and news, maintained by their good friend and manager, Aldon Miller.
