Hailing from the basement of the coolest house on the craziest cobblestone hill,  in Fitchburg, MA, Jay St. was the party band of the Fitchburg scene during the years of 2003-2005.  While actively playing out at Hoolingans bar, they were also well known for throwing some of the best parties.  (Even during the winter!)  Even though they are no more, their infamy lives on thanks to their recordings being unearthed and posted for all to enjoy.  So, if the dude abides, then so do we.  Oh yeah, mind if I do a J?
